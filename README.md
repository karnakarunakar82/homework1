# List
- Lists are used to group together related pieces of information so they are clearly associated with each other and easy to read
- Lists are good from a structural point of view as they help create a well-structured, more accessible, easy-to-maintain document.
# Types of List
- There are three list types in HTML:
  * unordered list — used to group a set of related items in no particular order
  * ordered list — used to group a set of related items in a specific order
  * description list — used to display name/value pairs such as terms and definitions
