# About List
    =>Lists are used to group together related pieces of information so they are clearly associated with each other and easy to read
    =>Lists are good from a structural point of view as they help create a well-structured, more accessible, easy-to-maintain document.
# Types of List
 There are three list types in HTML:
      unordered list — used to group a set of related items in no particular order
      ordered list — used to group a set of related items in a specific order
      description list — used to display name/value pairs such as terms and definitions
# Unordered List
    Unordered (bulleted) lists are used when a set of items can be placed in any order. An example is a shopping list:

          milk
          bread
          butter
          coffee beans
Although the items are all part of one list, you could put the items in any order and the list would still make sense:

          bread
          coffee beans
          milk
          butter
You can use CSS to change the bullet to one of several default styles, use your own image, or even display the list
